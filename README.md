# Shaping the future of science

The goal of this repo is to curate resources for shaping the future of science. We believe that [technical advances must support selection and evaluation, not just automation](https://cichicago.substack.com/p/the-mirage-of-autonomous-ai-scientists). We provide a roadmap that breaks down related tasks. The full picture is rich and we welcome contributions and discussions!

# Roadmap
  * Research ideation
    * [hypogenic AI](https://hypogenic.ai), support community discovery
  * Incorporate data-driven and literature-grounded hypothesis generation
    * [hypogenic](https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/hypothesis-generation)
    * [Asta](https://allenai.org/asta/agents)
  * Incorporate domain specific knowledge and tools
  * Expand the research plan
  * Automate part of the experiments
    * [remyx.ai](https://www.remyx.ai/) 
  * Accurate budget estimation
  * Evaluation
    * [Evaluating the evidence, qedscience](https://www.qedscience.com/)
  * Report draft
  * Proposal draft
