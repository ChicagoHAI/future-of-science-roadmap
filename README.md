The goal of this repo is to curate resources for shaping the future of science. We believe that [technical advances must support selection and evaluation, not just automation](https://cichicago.substack.com/p/the-mirage-of-autonomous-ai-scientists). We provide a roadmap that breaks down related tasks. The full picture is rich and we welcome contributions and discussions!
